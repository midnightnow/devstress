**Title:** Show HN: DevStress – Zero-Config Load Testing for Developers

**Comment:**
Hi HN! I built DevStress because I was tired of spending 30+ minutes setting up load tests for simple API checks.

The problem: Every load testing tool I tried required either learning a complex GUI (JMeter), writing YAML configs, setting up Docker, or signing up for cloud services. I just wanted to quickly test if my API could handle load.

The solution: DevStress. One command, instant results:

```
pip install devstress
devstress https://api.example.com
```

That's it. No configuration files, no cloud accounts, no Docker. It automatically detects your system capacity, generates meaningful load, and produces beautiful HTML reports.

Technical details:
- Built with Python async/await for true concurrency
- Can generate 28.6+ RPS with 200 concurrent users on a Mac Studio
- Smart resource management prevents self-DoS
- Rate limiting support for controlled tests
- Exit codes for CI/CD integration

It's not trying to replace enterprise tools - it's for developers who want to quickly validate their APIs without the complexity.

Would love your feedback!

🚀 Just launched DevStress - Zero-Config Load Testing for Developers

Tired of complex load testing setups? Now you can test your API in 30 seconds:

```
pip install devstress
devstress https://api.example.com
```

No YAML. No Docker. No cloud accounts.

🧵👇

**Tweet 2:**
The problem: Every developer knows they should load test, but...
- JMeter takes 30+ min to learn
- Cloud services want credit cards
- Even "simple" tools need config files

Result: We ship untested 😬

**Tweet 3:**
DevStress changes that:
✅ Zero configuration required
⚡ Instant results with live progress
📊 Beautiful HTML reports
🎯 Smart defaults that just work
🔧 CI/CD ready with exit codes

**Tweet 4:**
Real performance:
- 28.6 RPS with 200 concurrent users
- 6x faster than curl loops
- <10% CPU usage
- Linear scaling to system limits

Built with Python async/await for true concurrency.

**Tweet 5:**
It's open source and ready to use:

GitHub: github.com/midnightnow/devstress
PyPI: pip install devstress

Built for developers who value their time. Because load testing shouldn't require a PhD in distributed systems.

**🚀 Launching DevStress: Zero-Config Load Testing for Developers**

After years of watching teams skip load testing because the tools were too complex, I decided to build something different.

**The Problem:**
Every existing tool requires significant setup - learning JMeter's GUI, writing YAML for k6, configuring Docker for Locust, or paying for cloud services. For a simple "can my API handle load?" question, the setup often takes longer than the actual testing.

**The Solution:**
DevStress - load testing that respects your time.

```
pip install devstress
devstress https://api.example.com
```

That's the entire setup. No configuration files, no cloud accounts, no complexity.

**Key Features:**
• Zero configuration - smart defaults that work
• Live progress with instant feedback
• Beautiful HTML reports for stakeholders
• CI/CD integration with meaningful exit codes
• Resource-aware to prevent self-DoS

**Technical Implementation:**
Built with Python's async/await for true concurrency, achieving 28.6+ RPS with 200 concurrent users while using minimal system resources. The architecture automatically adapts to system capacity, making it safe to run on development machines.

**Philosophy:**
Not every team needs enterprise-grade load testing infrastructure. Sometimes you just need to know if your API can handle expected traffic. DevStress fills that gap.

It's open source and available now:
• GitHub: github.com/midnightnow/devstress
• PyPI: pypi.org/project/devstress

Looking forward to your feedback and contributions!

**Title:** I built a zero-config load testing tool because existing ones are too complex

After spending 30 minutes trying to set up JMeter just to test if my API could handle 100 concurrent users, I decided there had to be a better way.

**DevStress** - load test your API in 30 seconds:

```bash
pip install devstress
devstress https://api.example.com
```

That's literally it. No YAML files, no Docker, no cloud accounts.

**Features:**
- Zero configuration required
- Live progress bar with RPS metrics
- HTML reports with charts
- Smart resource management (won't kill your machine)
- CI/CD ready with exit codes

**Performance:**
- 28.6 RPS with 200 concurrent users
- 6x faster than curl loops
- Minimal resource usage (<10% CPU)

**Technical details:**
- Python async/await for true concurrency
- Token bucket rate limiting
- Automatic system capacity detection
- Three scenarios: steady, ramp, spike

It's not trying to replace k6 or Gatling for serious performance testing. It's for developers who want to quickly validate their APIs without the complexity.
