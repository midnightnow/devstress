## üìù Phase 5: Blog Post / Dev.to Article

### Title Ideas:
- "I Was Tired of Complex Load Testing Tools, So I Built DevStress"
- "Load Testing Shouldn't Require a PhD: Introducing DevStress"
- "From 30 Minutes to 30 Seconds: Simplifying API Load Testing"

### Article Structure:
```markdown
# The Problem
Every developer knows they should load test their APIs, but...
- Setting up JMeter feels like overkill
- Cloud services want your credit card
- Docker configs, YAML files, complex setups
- Result: We ship untested

# The Solution
What if load testing was as simple as:
`devstress https://api.example.com`

# How DevStress Works
- Async Python for true concurrency
- Smart resource management
- Beautiful reports
- Zero configuration

# Real Examples
[Show actual usage and results]

# Get Started
pip install devstress
```

## üó£Ô∏è Phase 6: Community Outreach

### Hacker News Post:
```
Title: Show HN: DevStress ‚Äì Zero-Config Load Testing for Developers
URL: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/devstress

Comment:
Hi HN! I built DevStress because I was tired of the complexity of existing load testing tools.

As developers, we know we should load test our APIs, but the friction is too high. JMeter requires learning a whole ecosystem, cloud services want credit cards, and even "simple" tools need config files.

DevStress changes that. One command, instant results:
`devstress https://api.example.com`

It automatically detects your system capacity, generates meaningful load, and produces beautiful reports. No Docker, no YAML, no cloud accounts.

Built with Python async/await for true concurrency. Can generate 10,000+ requests/second on modern hardware.

Would love your feedback!
```

### Reddit Posts (r/programming, r/webdev, r/Python):
```
Title: I built a zero-config load testing tool because existing ones are too complex

After spending 30 minutes trying to set up JMeter for a simple API test, I decided to build something better.

DevStress: Just run `devstress https://api.example.com` and get instant results.

Features:
- No configuration files
- Live progress with RPS metrics
- HTML reports with charts
- CI/CD ready with exit codes
- Smart resource management

Feedback welcome!
```

## üìä Phase 7: Documentation Site

### Options:
1. **GitHub Pages** (simplest)

   - Import from GitHub
   - Interactive documentation

## üé¨ Phase 8: Demo Creation

### Quick Terminal Recording:
