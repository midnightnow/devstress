============================================

üìä Test Configuration:
   Database: PostgreSQL (ecommerce @ prod-db.example.com)
   Total Test Duration: 300 seconds
   Peak Concurrent Connections: 350

üöÄ Executing Test Scenarios:

[00:15] Product Catalog Reads (200 connections)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Current RPS: 847/1000 target (84.7%)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ P95 Response Time: 42ms (target: <50ms) ‚úÖ
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Connection Pool Usage: 67% (134/200)
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Query Cache Hit Rate: 89%

[00:45] Inventory Updates (50 connections)  
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Current RPS: 178/200 target (89.0%)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ P95 Response Time: 87ms (target: <100ms) ‚úÖ
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Deadlocks Detected: 2 (acceptable)
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Lock Wait Time: 12ms average

[01:20] Order Processing Mixed (100 connections)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Current RPS: 156 (mixed read/write)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ P95 Response Time: 95ms ‚úÖ
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Transaction Success Rate: 99.2%
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Inventory Consistency: ‚úÖ Maintained

üìà Final Results:
   
Product Catalog Performance:
‚úÖ Average RPS: 923 (target: 1000)
‚úÖ P95 Response Time: 45ms (target: <50ms)  
‚úÖ P99 Response Time: 78ms (target: <100ms)
‚ö†Ô∏è  Cache Miss Rate: 11% (recommended: <5%)

Inventory Update Performance:
‚úÖ Average RPS: 189 (target: 200)
‚úÖ P95 Response Time: 89ms (target: <100ms)
‚úÖ Deadlock Rate: 0.01% (acceptable)
‚ö†Ô∏è  Lock Contention: 15ms average (recommended: <10ms)

Order Processing Performance:
‚úÖ Transaction Success Rate: 99.4%
‚úÖ Data Consistency: 100% verified
‚úÖ P95 Response Time: 92ms
‚ö†Ô∏è  Peak memory usage: 78% (monitor for spikes)

üéØ Recommendations:
1. Implement connection pooling optimization (current: 67% utilization)
2. Add database indexes on popular product queries
3. Consider read replicas for catalog queries (45% of total load)
4. Optimize inventory update queries to reduce lock contention
5. Implement query result caching to improve cache hit rates

üìã Bottleneck Analysis:
- Primary bottleneck: Inventory table lock contention during writes
- Secondary: Product catalog queries not using optimal indexes
- Network I/O: 23% of total response time (within acceptable range)
